Html and css
1) Adding a video background to the page. Download the video you want, it's big so compress it.
2) Make the input UI -> Make a countdown UI -> Make a waring UI(add animation and transform)


javascript
1) Add hidden to the other containers and unhide the input container
2) Make a javascript DOM element for every html element that changes 
3) You should only be able to choose a future data and not a previous data 
   For this -> There are some additional attributes that we can addd with the input type="data"
               you can set the minimum and maxi -> which has to be set dynamical instead of setting is already


4) Var d = new Date() -> to get todays data
   toISOString -> to follow a standard format to set data.
   const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

   set the attribute of the date picker to dynamically take todays date.

5) We want to get the data from the form on the submit of the button 
 To prevent the default submit behaviour we are using  e.preventDefault();

 updateCountdown(e) -> function to updateCountdown

 let countdownTitle = '';
let countdownDate = '';
and assign these variables the current date  and tittle countdownTitle = e.srcElement[0].value;
                                                        countdownDate = e.srcElement[1].value;


6) How to use this info to build an actual countdown.

 in the data object page -> we have a method called getTime().
 WE have to do some Math because getTime will return in miliseconds

 let countdownValue = Date;

 within updateCountdown function -> we are going to get the number version of date and update our DOM
  countdownValue = new Date(countdownDate).getTime();
    updateDOM();

Remove the hardcoded values in index.html
Make all const for the ui in javascript

Create the updateDOM() -> 1s = 1000ms
